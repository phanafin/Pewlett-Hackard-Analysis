# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## **THE SILVER TSUNAMI**

#### **OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS**
Pewlett-Hackard has an issue on their hands, they have a significant number of employees that will soon be eligible for retirement.  As a result, the company has requested some information on who these people are, exactly how many people may be involved, and which titles within the company are affected.  The company would also like to know if it's possible to offer potential retirees the opportunity to stay on part-time and work as mentors to new hires.  The information requested is available in the cooresponding documents as well as highlights below.

#### **RESULTS**
Pewlett-Hackard has requested information on the people who are eligible for retirement.  The company gave us a date range of 1/1/1952 and 12/31/1955 as possible birth date of retirement eligble employees.  As Pewlett-Hackard anticipated, the list is extensive, involving over 90,000 employees.  The total list is available in the file *retirement_titles.csv*.  The company also wanted to see a breakdown of the titles that will be impacted by this surge of retirees.  the list is as follows;

Next, the company would like to offer a mentoring opportunity to certain employees that are close, but not quite ready to retire.  These employees would be selceted to mentor new hires that are just starting out on their careers.  The list of eligible employees can be found in the document *mentorship_eligibility_csv*.

#### **SUMMARY**
The company wants to know specifically; How many roles will need to be filled as the "Silver Tsunami" begins to make an impact?  The answer is 90,398.
Also, the company wants to know if there are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees? As you can see, the following table shows the number of eligible mentors per title.  All titles are represented except for Managers.  There are only two retiring manages to begin with, and there probably isn't a need to have a mentoring program for management as they inherently know how to waste time with superfluous meetings and unnecessary tasks.
